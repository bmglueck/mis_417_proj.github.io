# MIS 417 Final Project
As part of a data analysis project, I investigated the CO2 emissions and MPG claims of various modern vehicles to assess their environmental impact. Using Python and libraries such as SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas, I performed a comprehensive analysis of the data, determining which companies had the best and worst CO2 emissions and whether there was a correlation between MPG and CO2 emissions. The project involved selecting appropriate data analysis methods, interpreting the results, and creating visualizations to support our conclusions. Documenting our findings in Jupyter Notebook, I gained practical experience in analyzing structured data and enhanced my Python coding skills. The project resulted in a strong grade and provided a solid foundation in data analysis techniques and environmental data interpretation.
